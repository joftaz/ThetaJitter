# ThetaJitter

This repository is the code base for my Thesis. The main goal is to understand if there is an induced power in the Theta band (4.5-8 Hz) in conflict  related tasks.

There are two competitive hypotheses:
1. In additional to the evoked signal (e.g. ERP) there are waves in the theta band which we are "induced" by the stimuli.
2. There is a transient signal with noise of the form of time jitter. When averaging the power of the trials it seems to have induced power which in fact is just an artifact of the frequency transform (i.e. wavelets).

Here I show that the second hypothesis can fully explain the data and the seems-like induced theta power.
